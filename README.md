# Zabbix Lambda Monitoring
Monitoring AWS lambdas using Zabbix

Architecture:
 - AWS side --> this project --> Zabbix side
 - AWS Lambda --> AWS CloudWatch --> metrics to this project --> Zabbix Proxy --> Zabbix Server --> Dashboard
    - Lambda sends metrics to CW in 1-minute intervals

Firehose Buffering:
 - Metric Sream --> Firehose Transform buffering --> Lambda --> Firehose buffering --> destination


# TODO

 - store Lambda Priority in Environment Variables
 - make priority per configured metric
    - each metric creates macros:
        - `<NAME>_<SEVERITY>:"<PRIORITY>"` -- same as now
    - in triggers, expressions will have constants:
        - `<NAME>_<SEVERITY>:\"{#<NAME>_PRIO}\"`
        - one "priority LLD macro" per configured metric
    - in discovery, the packet contains:
        - `{#FN_NAME}` = name of function
        - subset of `{#<NAME>_PRIO}` for all configured metric names
        - only triggers for the specified names will be discovered (**??**)
    - in AWS, these priorities are stored in PRIO env var
        - `PRIO='<name>:<priority> ...`
        - space-separated list of metric names and their priorities, separated by a colon

 - Resolve problems:
    - AWS Proxy keeps failing the trapper packets ??!!!?!?!?!!
    - "Time consistency"
        - Parallel transform Lambda invocations -- allow or not?
            - disable by setting Lambda timeout <= Firehose Buffering -- may be triggered early by size buffering setting
        - out-of-order delivery on Zabbix
            - Lambda invocation 0 has connectivity problems
            - Lambda invocation 1 delivers metrics to Zabbix
            - invocation delivers metrics -- after invoc 1! 
            - Earlier metrics delivered later than current latest metrics
            - Clock param of Zabbix Trapper protocol?
            - solve by eliminating parallelism?
    
    - controll packet size going to Zabbix
    - billing??

 - Benchmark the infrastructure:
    - maximum size of event is 6 MB (6291456 B)
    - 1000 active instances at once (at all times?)
    - Transform lambda duration, parallelism?
    - figure out good parameters -- Firehose buffering time and size, Lambda timeout, ...
    - mock Firehose? (Not to have actual 1000 lambda instances running at once all the time)
    - overload Trapper and Transform Lambda (how much required to overload) **!!**

 - Setup Metric Stream
    - CloudWatch -> Firehose -> Transformation Lambda -> "S3" / any other destination
        - send 1 packet to Zabbix per 1 metric stream record (not all at once) -- for correct timestamps

 - configure Zabbix
    - maybe change docker images to CentOS? Since the instances run on Amazon Linux, based off CentOS?

# Done
 - Naming Convention:
    - all 'names' (e.g. Zabbix item names, Zabbix host names or trigger names) must be same across Zabbix and AWS config!
        - set with central config script
        - main idea: the Zabbix host that manages its stuff has a 'simple' name or 'suffix', on which all other names are based
        - all zabbix names are lower-case, except for Lambda function name (anything outside of `[]` is lower-case)
        - LLD rule under the host has (item) name `discovery.<suffix>`
        - items have name `<zabbix_metric>.metrics.<suffix>[<function_name>]`
            - if one AWS metric has more statistics tracked by zabbix, the convention would be `<statistic>.<aws_metric>.metrics.<suffix>[<function_name>]`, e.g. `max.duration.metrics.multi-trigger-mapping-zblamb[{#FN_NAME}]` for item prototype
            - the real item name is defined while configuring the metric in `MetricConfigs` of `metrics_def.py`
        - triggers have name `<severity>.<zabbix_metric>.triggers.<suffix>[<function_name>]` 
        - proxy has name `proxy.<suffix>`
        - host group has name `group.<suffix>` 

 - Setup Metric Stream:
    - namespace: AWS/Lambda, metric: Errors, Duration
    - Firehose source = DirectPUT
    - CloudWatch sends accumulated metrics per 60 seconds
    - CloudWatch -> Firehose -> Transformation Lambda -> "S3" / any other destination
        - Transformation Lambda `basic_handler`:
            - can be in VPC with Zabbix Proxy/Server if the proxy/server is in a private subnet on EC2
            - takes data "to transform"
            - extracts ".values", ".timestamp" and ".dimensions.functionName" (from jsons with single dimension)
            - transforms extracted data to Zabbix Trapper packet based on configured metrics in `metrics_def.py`
            - sends extracted data to Zabbix Proxy/Server 
            - returns ``{"recordID": "provided ID by Firehose", "result": "Dropped", "data": ""}`` to Firehose
                - Firehorse does not pass it forward to the destination
        - periodically discover all Lambdas
            - after a specific period, crawl through all Lambda functions and discover them
            - ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD=0, since re-discovers only existing functions and not deleted in AWS
            - in Transform lambda (`if should_rediscover(): rediscover()`) or new Lambda, invoked periodically
            - no need to worry about faulty deletions in Zabbix
            - deleted functions in AWS might pend in Zabbix for a long time (deleted in beggining of re-discovery period)
            - must ensure discovery of new functions
                - just a boolean ZabbixMonitored Lambda Tag?
                - discovering just this function would delete every other function (ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD=0)
                - must ensure all functions are re-discovered with new function
                - either postpone or skip sending metrics of new function until discovered in periodic process, or send discovery packet with every function once a new function is found
            - priority updates: just update the priority in AWS and wait until next discovery period

 - Central cofiguration script
    - scripts config, template params
    - configure zapi mapping, transformation and metrics to stream using just single MetricConfig List
        - MetricConfig also includes name of AWS metric (and statistic) it maps to zabbix items
        - have python configuration file that would include just the MetricConfig List
        - propagate this List to zapi.py (config module), SAM template (metrics parameter) and Transform Lambda (metric mapping AWS->Zabbix)
            - Transform: from MetricConfigs, create JSON that maps AWS Metric + AWS statistic to Zabbix item name

 - configure Zabbix metrics
    - add host with name `<suffix>` (e.g. zblamb)
        - no interface
    - possible flows:
        - Single-Host Multi-Trigger Per-Lambda trapper items via Low-Level Discovery
            - Lambdas are tagged in AWS with a prioirty, e.g. `{PRIO=0}`
            - host + discovery rule with key e.g. `discovery.<suffix>`
            - mapping between Lambda priorities and Zabbix severities
                - each Lambda priority maps to multiple Zabbix severities (or rather triggers)
                - configuration: 2D table Lambda priorities Ã— Zabbix severities, entries = Constants for triggers
                    - constants say when a trigger for corresponding severity should trigger (for a function with corresponding priority)
                    - can leave out some entries = the priority does not trigger the left out severity
            - host macros
                - for each metric and each severity, create macros with context
                - context = lambda priority
                - value = configuration table entry for that severity/priority
                    - `PRIO=0` => `{#ERRORS_HIGH:0}=4`, `{#ERRORS_AVERAGE:0}=2`, `{#ERRORS_INFO:0}=1`
                    - `PRIO=3` => `{#ERRORS_AVERAGE:3}=5`, `{#ERRORS_INFO:3}=1`
                - do not create macros for left out entries
                - each macro has a default value (without context) for non-classified functions (not known or no priority)
                    - to "disable" these, put high number
            - item prototypes
                - for each metric, parametrized by function e.g. `error.metrics.<suffix>[${FN_NAME}]`/`min.duration.metrics.<suffix>[${FN_NAME}]`
            - trigger prototypes
                - create for each item and each Zabbix priority one trigger
                    - e.g. `INFO.error.metrics.<suffix>[${FN_NAME}]`/`AVERAGE.min.duration.metrics.<suffix>[${FN_NAME}]`
                - all triggers have same expression, just the constants differ
                    - `count(/<suffix>/errors.metrics.<suffix>[{#FN_NAME}],5m,"ge","{$ERROR_INFO:{#PRIO}}")>=1`    
                    - `count(/<suffix>/errors.metrics.<suffix>[{#FN_NAME}],5m,"ge","{$ERROR_HIGH:{#PRIO}}")>=1`
                - do not create triggers for left out entries in the configuration table
                    - using discovery rule Overrides

 - configure Zabbix infrastructure
    - passive agent --> proxy --> server
    - agent:
        - `Hostname` (for server/proxy) config already set via compose
            - and also not needed for passive checks
            - zblamb-agent
        - `Server` config already set via compose to proxy's private IP
    - proxy:
        - configure: https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/appendix/config/zabbix_proxy
        - docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/zabbix/zabbix-proxy-sqlite3
        - `Server` config already set to server's private IP
        - `Hostname` config set to zblamb-proxy
    - server:
        - add passive proxy:  (hostname, passive mode, interface)
        - add host group
        - add host monitored by proxy
        - add template to host

# Abandoned Ideas
 - Setup Metric Stream:
    - CloudWatch -> Firehose -> S3 bucket -> Lambda -> Zabbix Protocol -> Zabbix Proxy/Server
        - Lambda:
            - downloads the metric JSON(s) file(s)
            - the rest is same as `basic_handler`, does not have to return anything
    - CloudWatch -> Firehose -> HTTPS Endpoint -> Zabbix protocol -> Zabbix Proxy
        - HTTPS Endpoint must have public IP address
        - HTTPS Endpoint does the same as `basic_handler`, just complies with the endopoint mechanism
        - Firehose cannot currently access instances in a private VPC subnet
            - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-http
 
 - Setup Metric Stream
    - CloudWatch -> Firehose -> Transformation Lambda -> "S3" / any other destination
        - send 1 packet to Zabbix per 1 metric stream record (not all at once) -- for correct timestamps
        - do not discover already discovered Lambdas in Zabbix
            - "Cache" in Lambda tags:
                - ZabbixMonitored Tag: timestamp of time of discovery
                - Transform lambda config: after how long Zabbix deletes the discovered objects 
                - Transform lambda could (should) re-discover before Zabbix keep period expires
            - Zabbix discovered objects have state: discovered, no longer discovered
                - state changes to "discovered" when last discovery packet includes its LLD macros
                - state changes to "no longer discovered" when last discovery packet does not include its LLD macros
                - when new discovery packet arrives without its LLD macros in "no longer discovered" state and keep period expires, the object is deleted
            - optimal values:
                - ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD: 
                    1. find expected rate d (= 1/period) of least frequent Lambda Function
                    1. using exponential distribution with rate=d, find time interval T, in which it is highly probable that the least frequent function will get invoked
                        - e.g. 99.99 percentile = 9.210340/d = ~ 9 times the period
                        - 99.9 percentile = 6.907755/d = ~ 7 times the period
                        - p percentile = ln(1/(1-p))/d = ln(1/(1-p)) times the period
                    1. set ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD >= T
                        - very high probability that even the least frequent function is invoked prior to expiration in Zabbix
                - AWS re-discovery period for Lambda function F:
                    - for all functions, including the least frequent one
                    1. find expected rate Fd of function F
                    1. get time interval FT, in which F is very likely to get invoked (same percentile as with ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD)
                        - FT = ln(1/(1-p))/d, p is same as chosen in ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD, d is characteristic of F
                    1. set re-discovery period for F to ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD - FT
                        - => the least frequent function will have re-discovery period of 0 => re-discover each time
                        - not true if ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD > T
                - expiration of ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD in Zabbix is very likely for functions that do not exist anymore
                - assumption of exponential behavior! For better results, find conrete rate distribution of each function
                - ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD > T reduces communication, but deleted functions may pend longer in Zabbix
            - Configuration:
                - pick ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD > P*expected_max_period and set AWS re-descovery period to ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD/P
                    - probability of re-discovery of least frequent is 1-e^(1-P), assuming exponential behavior
                        - P=2 => 63.21 %, P=7 => 99.91 %
                    - all functions invoked more frequently than the least frequent one will be re-discovered unnecessarilly often, but it should be very unlikely that a function will get unintentionally deleted
                    - the higher P, the less likely are faulty deletions, but the higher is amount communication
                    - also the higher P, the longer it takes Zabbix to remove a function (they might pend for a long time)
                    - currently set to P=2 (ZBX_LLD_KEEP_PERIOD should be configured accordingly)

 - Configure Zabbix Metrics
    - possible flows:
        - aggregate functions
            - add trapper items to the host (`<suffix>=zblamb-lambda-errors`):
                - error-stream: text entries, just a stream of AWS Lambda names that failed (with the correct number of failures from CloudWatch)
                - error-log: log entries, contains severity, function name and number of failed invocations
                - error-counts: number entries, just a number of failures, aggregated across all Lambda functions
                - error-count-string: text entries, comma-delimited repetition of FnName, number of repetitions is number of failures
            - create a trigger based on at least one of the items
                - `count(/zblamb-lambda-errors/error-count-string, 5m, "([A-Za-z0-9]+),\1,\1",regex)>0` --> "A lambda keeps failing"
                    - Tags: Key="Lambda Name", Value=` "{{ITEM.VALUE}.regsub(\"([A-Za-z0-9]+),\\1,\\1\", \"\\1\")}" `
                    - Allow multiple triggers with correlation tag "Lambda Name"
                    - Allow manual close
                    - These setting wills report errors per-function
        - Single-Host Single-Trigger Per-Lambda trapper items via Low-Level Discovery
            - like Multi-Trigger, but simpler
            - config: two simple mappings Lambda Priority -> Zabbix Severity, Lambda Priority -> Constant Value
            - macros: for each metric and priority (with context), not for severities, according to Priority -> Constant mapping
            - item prototypes: same as Multi-Trigger
            - trigger prototypes:
                - one trigger per item
                - using discovery rule Overrides, change the severity during discovery to the one corresponding to Priority -> Severity mapping
            - Priority -> Severity mapping tells what severity that priority has
            - Priority -> Constant mapping tells when the trigger with that severity should set off
